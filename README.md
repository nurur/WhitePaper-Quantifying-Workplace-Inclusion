Executive Summary:

Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) are two distinct organizational practices that play critical roles in driving the 
workforce dynamics. It is recognized that diverse and inclusive organizational culture promotes creativity and 
innovation in the workplace. To have a sustainable growth in the competitive market, it is, therefore, imperative 
that organizations should take appropriate actions to implement these practices and measure their impacts on the 
workforce.

While workplace diversity metrics are well-known and readily available to D&I practitioners, the concept of 
measuring workplace inclusion is relatively new and is rarely described in organizational literature. The 
unavailability of useful inclusion measures undermines an organization’s efforts to understand, recognize, and 
improve the existing culture of the workforce. 

To help D&I practitioners to succeed in workplace inclusion initiatives, in this article, we introduce a collection 
of seven metrics to effectively measure employee’s perception of workplace inclusion. The set of metrics include 
1) decision-making influence, 2) access to critical information (to do the job), 3) job security, 4) individual 
well-being, 5) job satisfaction, 6) organizational commitment, and 7) workgroup (social) integration. These metrics 
have been studied in Organizational Psychology and Organizational Management literature and have shown to be effective 
in measuring workplace inclusion.
